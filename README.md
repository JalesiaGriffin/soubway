### Sandwich Shop Menu Project Summary:

This Soubway Shop Menu project is a Java application designed to streamline the ordering process for a 
sandwich shop. The system utilizes a modular and extensible architecture to manage various aspects of 
the menu, pricing, and user interactions. It also records
specific order by time and date making record keeping very easy for both
employees and customers.
